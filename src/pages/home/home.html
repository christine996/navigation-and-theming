    The tree is a very commonly encountered data shape that allows us to represent hierarchical relationships.

It turns out that many of the structures we encounter when writing software are hierarchical. For instance, every file and directory within a file system is “inside” one and only one parent directory, up to the root directory. In an HTML document, every tag is inside one and only one parent tag, up to the root (html) tag.

It also turns out that that we can use trees to implement useful data structures like maps, and to do fast searches. We will cover some of the many use cases for trees in this section, as well as exploring algorithms to traverse through trees.
